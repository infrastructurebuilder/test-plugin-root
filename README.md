# ibversions-maven-plugin

Generates a local code resource with version data.

In order to utilize the test code (which gets generated by default), you'll need a dependency on the `org.json` `JSONObject` at `<scope>test<scope>`

Test coverage is a bit lower than we'd like due to how effing hard it is to test Maven plugins.  We might refactor this into a component for
easier testing.

# IMPORTANT:

As of version 0.14.0+, the output of a Java generation for ibversions-maven-plugin (currently the only working generator), requires a depenency
on `org.infrastructurebuilder:ibexceptions` of version 29 or greater.
